! Define some scroll actions on keys that are unlikely to be a problem
! This means that "xdotool key ctrl+F13" will scroll up, and "alt+F13" down.
! Activate this file with "xrdb -merge scroll-translations"
! Unfortunately it doesn't work in xfce4-terminal, gnome-terminal,
! mate-terminal, or rxvt-unicode. Works in xterm though...

! xterm -xrm 'XTerm.VT100.translations: #override Ctrl<Key>F13: scroll-back(3,line) \n Alt<Key>F13: scroll-forw(3,line)'

XTerm.VT100.translations: #override \
	Ctrl<Key>F12: scroll-back(1,line) \n\
	Ctrl<Key>F13: scroll-back(3,line) \n\
	Alt<Key>F13: scroll-forw(3,line)
