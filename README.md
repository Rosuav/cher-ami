Named for the homing pigeon that saved the Lost Battalion in 1918.

Twitter client. Runs in a terminal. If available, will use xterm mouse access
to allow some very limited "click here to X" functionality.

Almost entirely read-only. Will have real-time monitoring of the timeline,
and can shoot any tweet up to the browser on request, but does NOT allow any
custom tweeting. At most, it will allow "Like" and maybe "Retweet", but not
"Retweet with message" (aka "quote").

TODO: Figure out which, if any, pip-installable module to use.

Requirements: Python
